Data Manipulation
=========================

.. index:: dplyr, tidyverse


``dplyr`` is a grammar for data manipulation. It provides a consistent set of operations which are
sufficient to take care of most data manipulation tasks.

In a data frame we have columns representing different variables and rows representing different records.

The typical data manipulation tasks are:

- Selecting few variables (columns) from a data set
- Filtering the rows (cases) based on the values of specific variables (columns)
- Summarizing (reducing) the dataset
