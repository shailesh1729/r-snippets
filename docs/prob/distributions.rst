Standard Probability Distributions
======================================================================

Functions for several probability distributions are provided as part of R.
Some distribution are available in the global space. Additional distributions
are available through some packages.  

Each distribution has a name in R (e.g. norm, beta, t, f, etc.). 
For each distribution following functions are provided:

* Probability Density (Mass) Function (dnorm, dbeta, dt, df, etc.)
* Cumulative Distribution Function (pnorm, pbeta, , pt, pf, etc.)
* Quantile or Inverse Cumulative Distribution Function (qnorm, qbeta, qt, qf, etc.)
* Random Number Generator for the given distribution (rnorm, rbeta, rt, rf, etc.)
