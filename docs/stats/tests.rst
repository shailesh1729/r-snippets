Statistical Tests
============================

In hypothesis testing, a p-value helps us determine the significance
of the results. There is a null hypothesis and an alternate hypothesis.
A hypothesis test uses p-value to weigh the strength of the evidence
is support of alternative hypothesis.

* A small p-value (typically â‰¤ 0.05) indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.

* A large p-value (> 0.05) indicates weak evidence against the null hypothesis, so you fail to reject the null hypothesis.

* p-values very close to the cutoff (0.05) are considered to be marginal (could go either way). Always report the p-value so your readers can draw their own conclusions.



Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test
--------------------------------

.. index:: normality test, shapiro.test

This test is applicable to check the normality of a univariate sample::

	> shapiro.test(ToothGrowth$len)

		Shapiro-Wilk normality test

	data:  ToothGrowth$len
	W = 0.96743, p-value = 0.1091


The null-hypothesis here is that the distribution is normally distributed.
If the p-value is > 0.05, we have weak evidence against the null hypothesis.
Hence we infer that the distribution of the data
is not significantly different from normal distribution. 

Applying the test on uniform data::

	> shapiro.test(runif(100))

		Shapiro-Wilk normality test

	data:  runif(100)
	W = 0.9649, p-value = 0.009121

Clearly the p-value is quite low, so we reject the contention that the data is normally
distributed.

For exponentially distributed data::

	> shapiro.test(rexp(100))

		Shapiro-Wilk normality test

	data:  rexp(100)
	W = 0.86374, p-value = 3.952e-08


Gamma distribution::

	> shapiro.test(rgamma(100, shape=1))

		Shapiro-Wilk normality test

	data:  rgamma(100, shape = 1)
	W = 0.86356, p-value = 3.89e-08


Binomial distribution::

	> shapiro.test(rbinom(100, size = 15, prob=0.1))

		Shapiro-Wilk normality test

	data:  rbinom(100, size = 15, prob = 0.1)
	W = 0.90717, p-value = 3.124e-06
