This data set contains records of growth of orange trees. 
Growth is measured in terms of the circumference of a tree
at a specific age.
The data set contain records for 5 trees. 
For each tree, there are 7 records for 7 different days on which
circumference was measured.
The age of a tree is measured in the number of days 
since 1968/12/31. There are 7 specific days on which
measurements have been taken: [118  484  664 1004 1231 1372 1582].

```{r}
require(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
str(Orange)
```

A simple scatter plot: 

```{r}
qplot(age,circumference, data=Orange, geom="point")
```

Using different color for tracking the growth of each tree:

```{r}
qplot(data=Orange, x=age, y=circumference, geom="point", color=Tree)
```

Tracking the growth for each tree in separate line:

```{r}
qplot(data=Orange, x=age, y=circumference, geom="smooth", color=Tree, se=FALSE)
```
